## Overview

"I Shall Live as a Prince" follows the story of an ordinary man from the modern world who is reincarnated as Grand Prince Jinseong, the younger brother of the infamous tyrant King Yeonsangun of the Joseon Dynasty. Knowing the tragic fate that awaits the royal family and the kingdom, the protagonist decides to use his modern knowledge to change history. Unlike many cultivation or OP protagonist stories, this manhwa focuses on political maneuvering, brotherly bonds, and the subtle influence of a modern mindset on a historical era to save the kingdom from doom.

## Story & World

The narrative revolves around the protagonist's survival and his efforts to steer his brother, the King, away from tyranny. The story is set in the Joseon era, grounded in historical context but altered by the protagonist's interventions.

> "How the protagonist uses his modern knowledge to rise and saves his kingdom from doom. He is the brother of the King and in the end of the story he becomes the king of his kingdom."

The world-building faithfully recreates the atmosphere of the Joseon Dynasty, focusing on court politics, societal structures, and the daily life of royalty, while introducing modern concepts introduced by the main character.

## Characters

**Grand Prince Jinseong (Protagonist)** - Reincarnated with memories of the future, he acts as a stabilizing force for his volatile brother. He is intelligent, calculated, and ultimately rises to the challenge of leadership.

**King Yeonsangun** - The historical tyrant who, in this timeline, is influenced by his brother. The dynamic between him and the protagonist is a central pillar of the story.

## Art & Presentation

The artwork by Kim Tae-Hyung provides a solid visualization of the Joseon era. It effectively captures the historical setting, costumes, and the emotional gravity of the political drama.

*Rating: 7.5/10*

## Themes & Impact

-   **Leadership and Responsibility**: The journey from a prince trying to survive to a king accepting his burden.
-   **Modern Knowledge vs. Tradition**: The protagonist uses his future knowledge not to overpower enemies with force, but to improve the kingdom's stability and economy.
-   **Family**: The complex relationship between the brothers is at the heart of the narrative.

## Personal Notes & Observations

I found this manhwa pretty amazing. It's not something I normally like as there's no Cultivation or OP MC, but still, I enjoyed it very much. I won't put it in my list of Best Manhwas I've read, but it's still a good and relaxing manhwa to read.

## Memorable Moments So Far

-   The protagonist's rise to power using modern wisdom.
-   The deviation from actual history where he saves the kingdom instead of watching it fall.
-   The ending where he ascends to the throne.

## Reread Value

**Would I reread?** Likely not immediately, but it remains a "good and relaxing" read.

**Best for:** Readers who enjoy historical dramas with a smart protagonist and political intrigue rather than pure action or cultivation.

**Similar series:**
- Doctor's Rebirth (Manhwa - Modern medical knowledge in Murim world)
- The Greatest Estate Developer (Manhwa - Civil engineering knowledge in medieval setting)
- I Shall Master This Family (Manhwa - Future knowledge to change family's fate)

## Additional Context

This series concludes with the protagonist becoming King, a satisfying localized ending that resolves the main conflicts of the era. It stands out for its "relaxing" pace compared to more high-octane manhwas.
