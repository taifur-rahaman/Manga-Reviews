## Overview

*(To be updated as I continue reading)*

"The Top Dungeon Farmer" (also known as "Solo Farming in the Tower") is a unique twist on the dungeon crawler genre. Instead of the typical adventurer role, the story follows Sejun, an ordinary Seoul resident who unexpectedly finds himself trapped in a mysterious dungeon and becomes... a farmer. Rather than battling monsters, he focuses on cultivating and selling cash crops while completing various quests and surviving with optimism, resourcefulness, and the help of loyal monster companions.
