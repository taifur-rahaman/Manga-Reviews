## Overview

*(To be updated as I continue reading)*

"Beyond Myriad Peoples" (often known as "Above Ten Thousand People") is a comedy cultivation manhua about a protagonist who is an unmatched powerhouse but believes he is a mere mortal without any cultivation base. He lives a "simple" life, unaware that his every action shakes the world and that the "items" he creates are supreme artifacts.

## Story & World

*(To be updated as I continue reading)*

The story revolves around the misunderstanding between the overpowered main character and the cultivation world. While he thinks he's just running a small shop/gym and trying to survive among cultivators, the most powerful experts in the world see him as a reclusive, god-like senior. The humor comes from the gap between his perceived weakness and his actual, terrifying strength.

## Characters

*(To be updated as I continue reading)*

**Lin Fan (Protagonist)** - The "mortal" main character who is actually a supreme existence. He is clueless about his own power and treats legendary beasts and artifacts as common pets and tools.

## Art & Presentation

## Themes & Impact

*(To be updated as I continue reading)*

Early themes emerging:
- **Misunderstandings**: The core comedic element where the MC's actions are over-interpreted by others.
- **Hidden Expert**: The trope of a powerful being living as a mortal.
- **Parody**: Satirizing typical cultivation tropes.

## Personal Notes & Observations

*(Raw thoughts as I read)*

Just started reading this series on 7th February 2026. It's a "Clueless OP MC" story similar to "Am I Invincible".

## Reread Value

**Would I reread?** (To be determined)

**Best for:** Fans of misunderstanding-based comedies and OP protagonists who don't know they are OP.

**Similar series:**
- [Am I Invincible](am_i_invincible.md) (Manhua - Clueless OP MC) ✅ *Already Read*
- I'm Actually a Cultivation Bigshot (Manhua - Similar premise)
- I'm Really Not The Demon God's Lackey (Manhua - Normal guy misunderstood as Entity)
- The Unmatched Powerhouse Just Wants To Farm (Manhua - Farmer MC)

## Additional Context

This series is produced by Boyi Animation and started in 2021. It is frequently compared to "Am I Invincible" due to the nearly identical premise of a protagonist effectively being a god while thinking he is a mortal.
