## Overview

*(To be updated as I continue reading)*

"Beyond Myriad Peoples" (often known as "Above Ten Thousand People") is a comedy cultivation manhua about a protagonist who is an unmatched powerhouse but believes he is a mere mortal without any cultivation base. He lives a "simple" life, unaware that his every action shakes the world and that the "items" he creates are supreme artifacts.

## Story & World

*(To be updated as I continue reading)*

The story revolves around the misunderstanding between the overpowered main character and the cultivation world. While he thinks he's just running a small shop/gym and trying to survive among cultivators, the most powerful experts in the world see him as a reclusive, god-like senior. The humor comes from the gap between his perceived weakness and his actual, terrifying strength.

## Characters

## Themes & Impact

*(To be updated as I continue reading)*

Early themes emerging:
- **Misunderstandings**: The core comedic element where the MC's actions are over-interpreted by others.
- **Hidden Expert**: The trope of a powerful being living as a mortal.
- **Parody**: Satirizing typical cultivation tropes.

## Personal Notes & Observations

*(Raw thoughts as I read)*

Just started reading this series on 7th February 2026. It's a "Clueless OP MC" story similar to "Am I Invincible".

### Progress Update - Chapter 235 (11th February 2026)

**Observations:**

- **Artwork:** After 235 chapters, the art still could use some work. Feels like they're going for that One Piece vibe - you know, decent artwork but carried by an incredible story. Thing is, while the story here is good, it's not quite at that "amazing" level to pull off the same magic. The style remains consistent with that "carried by story" approach, though at this point I've gotten used to it. It does the job of conveying the comedy and action, but it's definitely not going to win any awards for visual excellence.

- **World Building vs Main Story:** The author really went all-in on side characters and world building. Like, I appreciate the effort to create a rich universe, but sometimes I'm just sitting here wondering what happened to the main cast. This pattern has continued throughout - we've had multiple arcs focused on various disciples, side characters, and different cultivation realms. While some of these arcs are genuinely entertaining, it's not confusing or anything, just feels like the focus shifted a bit too much. The world is definitely rich and well-developed, but sometimes it feels like we're on a very scenic detour.

- **The Comedy Still Hits:** The core misunderstanding comedy that makes this series work is still going strong. Lin Fan continues to be hilariously oblivious to his own power, and watching other cultivators misinterpret his every action never gets old. This is really the backbone that keeps me reading - the comedic timing and absurdity of the situations are consistently entertaining.

- **Pacing Observations:** With 235 chapters under my belt, I can say the pacing is... leisurely. We're not rushing anywhere, and the story takes its time exploring every corner of this world. For a "clueless OP MC" comedy, this works better than it would for a serious cultivation story, but I do wonder if tighter pacing could have made this even better.

- **The Weird Thing About Enjoyment:** Here's the funny part - I'm actually really enjoying this! But because I'm enjoying it so much, I'm noticing all these flaws way more than I would with other titles. I think I have this weird habit where if I like something, I want it to be absolutely perfect at everything. It's like my brain goes "this is great, but it could be LEGENDARY if they just fixed X, Y, and Z." The fact that I've read 235 chapters speaks volumes about how much fun I'm having, even if I'm critiquing it along the way. The series knows what it is and does it well, even if it's not perfect. Still having a blast reading it though!

### Final Thoughts - Completed (13th February 2026)

**The Ending Arc - A Disappointing Conclusion:**

To be frank, the ending arc went completely over my head. I didn't even enjoy it in the least. I just went through the chapters only because I had few chapters left to complete it. It started as strong and fun, but at the end, reading it became like chores rather than something I was reading for fun and enjoyment.

The series had such a promising beginning with its comedy and misunderstanding-based humor, but somewhere along the way - especially in the final arc - it lost what made it special. The shift from enjoyable comedy to a slog was jarring. I found myself pushing through just to say I finished it, not because I was genuinely invested anymore.

It's a shame because the first 200+ chapters were genuinely entertaining, but the ending left a sour taste that colors my overall impression of the series.

### Rating Breakdown

| Category | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Artwork** | **3.9/10** | Frequently inconsistent and unpolished; relies too heavily on simplifications and fails to deliver visual impact even in key moments |
| **Plot** | **4.4/10** | Structure completely breaks down in later arcs; narrative threads become tangled and the conclusion is unsatisfyingly abrupt |
| **Story** | **4.5/10** | Promising concept that collapses under its own weight; the final arc is a chore that actively detracts from the experience |
| **Character Development** | **6.5/10** | Main character stays consistent (which is the point), but side characters get too much screen time which bloats the narrative |
| **Enjoyment** | **7/10** | Still entertaining due to the comedy, despite the objective flaws in writing and art |
| **Pace** | **4.5/10** | Drags significantly with unnecessary filler arcs, making the reading experience feel like a chore by the end |
| **Overall** | **5.13/10** | Started strong and fun, ended as a chore - the disappointing conclusion overshadows the entertaining beginning |

## Verdict

**Beyond Myriad Peoples** started with so much promise - a hilarious misunderstanding-based comedy with an overpowered protagonist who thinks he's just a regular guy. The first 200+ chapters were genuinely entertaining, with solid comedic timing and absurd situations that kept me engaged.

However, the series gradually lost its way. The focus shifted too much to world-building and side characters at the expense of the main story. The pacing became leisurely to the point of being sluggish. And worst of all, the ending arc was a complete disappointment - confusing, unenjoyable, and turned what was once fun reading into a chore I only finished out of obligation.

It's a shame because this could have been something special. Instead, it's a series that peaked early and couldn't maintain its momentum, leaving a sour taste that overshadows the good times.

**Final Score: 5.13/10** - Good start, disappointing finish.

### Memorable Moments So Far

## Reread Value

**Would I reread?** No. The disappointing ending and the fact that it became a chore to finish means I wouldn't put myself through it again. Maybe I'd revisit some of the early chapters for the comedy, but definitely not the whole series.

**Best for:** Fans of misunderstanding-based comedies and OP protagonists who don't know they are OP.

**Similar series:**
- [Am I Invincible](am_i_invincible.md) (Manhua - Clueless OP MC) ✅ *Already Read*
- I'm Actually a Cultivation Bigshot (Manhua - Similar premise)
- I'm Really Not The Demon God's Lackey (Manhua - Normal guy misunderstood as Entity)
- The Unmatched Powerhouse Just Wants To Farm (Manhua - Farmer MC)

## Additional Context

This series is produced by Boyi Animation and started in 2021. It is frequently compared to "Am I Invincible" due to the nearly identical premise of a protagonist effectively being a god while thinking he is a mortal.
