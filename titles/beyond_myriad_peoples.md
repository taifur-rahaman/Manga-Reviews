## Overview

*(To be updated as I continue reading)*

"Beyond Myriad Peoples" (often known as "Above Ten Thousand People") is a comedy cultivation manhua about a protagonist who is an unmatched powerhouse but believes he is a mere mortal without any cultivation base. He lives a "simple" life, unaware that his every action shakes the world and that the "items" he creates are supreme artifacts.

## Story & World

*(To be updated as I continue reading)*

The story revolves around the misunderstanding between the overpowered main character and the cultivation world. While he thinks he's just running a small shop/gym and trying to survive among cultivators, the most powerful experts in the world see him as a reclusive, god-like senior. The humor comes from the gap between his perceived weakness and his actual, terrifying strength.

## Characters

*(To be updated as I continue reading)*

**Lin Fan (Protagonist)** - The "mortal" main character who is actually a supreme existence. He is clueless about his own power and treats legendary beasts and artifacts as common pets and tools.

## Art & Presentation

*(To be updated as I continue reading)*

Boyi Animation handles the artwork, known for its vibrant and clear style that suits the comedic tone of the series.

*Rating: TBD*

## Themes & Impact

*(To be updated as I continue reading)*

Early themes emerging:
- **Misunderstandings**: The core comedic element where the MC's actions are over-interpreted by others.
- **Hidden Expert**: The trope of a powerful being living as a mortal.
- **Parody**: Satirizing typical cultivation tropes.

## Personal Notes & Observations

*(Raw thoughts as I read)*

Just started reading this series on 7th February 2026. It's a "Clueless OP MC" story similar to "Am I Invincible".

### Progress Update - Chapter 70 (9th February 2026)

**Observations:**

- **Artwork:** Honestly, the art could use some work. Feels like they're going for that One Piece vibe - you know, decent artwork but carried by an incredible story. Thing is, while the story here is good, it's not quite at that "amazing" level to pull off the same magic.

- **World Building vs Main Story:** The author really went all-in on side characters and world building. Like, I appreciate the effort to create a rich universe, but sometimes I'm just sitting here wondering what happened to the main cast. It's not confusing or anything, just feels like the focus shifted a bit too much.

- **The Weird Thing About Enjoyment:** Here's the funny part - I'm actually really enjoying this! But because I'm enjoying it so much, I'm noticing all these flaws way more than I would with other titles. I think I have this weird habit where if I like something, I want it to be absolutely perfect at everything. It's like my brain goes "this is great, but it could be LEGENDARY if they just fixed X, Y, and Z." Still having a blast reading it though!

## Reread Value

**Would I reread?** (To be determined)

**Best for:** Fans of misunderstanding-based comedies and OP protagonists who don't know they are OP.

**Similar series:**
- [Am I Invincible](am_i_invincible.md) (Manhua - Clueless OP MC) ✅ *Already Read*
- I'm Actually a Cultivation Bigshot (Manhua - Similar premise)
- I'm Really Not The Demon God's Lackey (Manhua - Normal guy misunderstood as Entity)
- The Unmatched Powerhouse Just Wants To Farm (Manhua - Farmer MC)

---

## Additional Context

This series is produced by Boyi Animation and started in 2021. It is frequently compared to "Am I Invincible" due to the nearly identical premise of a protagonist effectively being a god while thinking he is a mortal.
