His life takes a dramatic turn when he's summoned to another world by a dragon who needs his expertise to treat a sick pet.

The fantasy world is populated with magical beasts and creatures that require specialized care, creating endless opportunities for creative storytelling. Ohjin's practical veterinary skills become invaluable in a world where such expertise is rare, allowing him to carve out a unique niche as a doctor for strange animals.
