## Overview

"8th Circle Mage Reborn" follows Henry Morris, an 8th-circle wizard who is executed under false accusations of treason. After his death, he is reborn into a new body with all his magical knowledge and memories intact. Now, armed with the power of an 8th-circle mage in a younger body, Henry seeks revenge against those who betrayed him and aims to change his tragic fate.

*This is a classic regression/reincarnation revenge story with a magic-focused power system. The series completed its run on December 6, 2023, with a total of 160 chapters.*

## Story & World

*(To be updated as I progress through the series)*

The world operates on a circle-based magic system, where mages advance through circles (1st to 9th), with each circle representing a significant leap in power. The 8th Circle is considered legendary, with very few mages ever reaching it.

## Characters

**Protagonist** - An 8th Circle mage who regressed to his younger self. Armed with future knowledge and magical mastery, he's determined to change his fate and exact revenge.
